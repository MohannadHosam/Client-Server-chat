# Socket Programming
The main idea behind Socket Programming is that you must put an ip address of the Client Socket (basically a local host) and port number. Then you put the port number
indicated in the Client side into the Server side.
# Run "TCPServer.java"

# Run "TCPClient.java"
As the Client initaites the connection with the Server.
